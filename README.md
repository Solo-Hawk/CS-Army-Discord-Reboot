# CS Army Discord Reboot

This is the reboot of the reboot. It is written using a more up-to-date implementation of cogs and extensions.

Please give me feedback as I am pretty new to this type of project.

NOTE: When using this ensure to edit config with welcome_id and auth_ids

## I want to help

If you're seeing this straight from my Github profile, then to help understand, this bot serves a discord server know as CS Army. This server was created by Devon Crawford - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDrekHmOnkptxq3gUU0IyfA) to help bring programmers together.

For those who want to help, a team is within the server to develop the bot - [Join here](https://discord.gg/drD7TAH)

The bot repo isn't fully set up to be effective with people forking just yet, but I'm getting there. Hiding the config and such is necessary, or just untracking and leaving blank template .json files.

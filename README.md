# CS Army Discord Reboot

Since keeping this project dormant for a while I needed to just reach a point where my overall productivity went up before actually doing anything, this mainly started with my Uni work and slowly leaked into other areas. Thanks to this I finally made a deployable version of the bot. 

The current set of issues is with modularity, downtimes and updates. Also being able to trying to push fixes without distrupting the bot's uptime, evern for a few seconds.

I basically celotaped a quick working version, making it easier to do things now.

During this time I will doing a lot of fixes and cleaning up code, making some methods more efficient and seeing where I can improve on using better 'models'

For me it has been a very long while since I have done some larger projects but starting small I'm going to be working up again.

## I want to help

If you're seeing this straight from my Github profile, then to help understand, this bot serves a discord server know as CS Army. This server was created by Devon Crawford - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDrekHmOnkptxq3gUU0IyfA) to help bring programmers together.

For those who want to help, a team is within the server to develop the bot - [Join here](https://discord.gg/drD7TAH)

The bot repo isn't fully set up to be effective with people forking just yet, but I'm getting there. Hiding the config and such is necessary, or just untracking and leaving blank template .json files.
